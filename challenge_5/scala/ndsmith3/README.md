Find the Difference
---

Pretty simple one here. Filters out all characters from the modified string that appear in the original string, then returns the new string's head.

Uses the example given from the README, but will work with the character inserted anywhere.

NOTE: If more than one character is inserted, it will only return the inserted character that shows up in the string first.
