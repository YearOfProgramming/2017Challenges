# Find The Difference

Solution is as follows:
    1. Given s, t, convert the string into an array.
    2. Sort both arrays
    3. Iterate through both arrays simultaneously until I find the difference

For the solution, I will be reimplementing quicksort for the sorting of the two arrays.

For the unit test, I will be using [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit4/)
