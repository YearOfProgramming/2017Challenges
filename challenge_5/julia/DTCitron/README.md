# Find the Difference

## Premise

-	Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters. String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position. Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.

-	I wrote a unit test for python users to accompany this challenge. Feel free to write your own unit tests so that others can use it to better their code! The test is under the folder mjuiuc

## Implementation

- Call `julia findthedifference.jl' in the `src' directory
- Using julia's sort function, start by sorting the characters contained in the two strings
- Loop through the characters in the smaller string ('s') and compare to the characters in the larger string ('t')
- Return the difference detected by the element-by-element comparison
