Given two input strings s and t, where t is a scrambled version of s with a new
character inserted somewhere at random in the string, finds the new character.
Collects frequencies of characters in s and t and matches them to find anomaly.

To run test, either un-comment last two lines and run:
python FindTheDifference.py

or use test.py (copied from mjuiuc's folder for convenience, edited for python 3):
python test.py
