### 1. Approch to solving the probelm

Pretty self explainitory, just getting the basics down and making sure everything is correct.

### 2. How to compile and run this

In Windows - I used the Visual Studio C++ compiler, move to the proper directory and run:

```
cl.exe src/HelloWorld.cpp
HelloWorld.exe
```

### 3. How this program works

The program just outputs "Hello, World!" on the main output stream.
