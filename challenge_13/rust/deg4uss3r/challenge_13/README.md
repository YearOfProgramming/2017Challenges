# Challenge 13
The challenge was to report if a number was a pallendrone (e.g. 11222211) from the command line as stdin. 

You were allowed to cast the input once to a number (forced to actually) then solve the problem using number and math I guess.

# Rust Solution
I used [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) more info below

## How to Run

You can run /target/release/challenge_13 like so:
`echo "1234554321 | .//target/release/challenge_13`

or 

`cat ../../../test/test1 | /target/release/challenge_13`

and so on :) 

## How to Test

You can run the bash testing I setup using the test files provided like: 

`./tests/test_suite.bsh` 


Run this from your `2017Challenges/challenge_13/rust/deg4uss3r/challenge_13` directory for the directory structure to work in bash (I'm being lazy here).
