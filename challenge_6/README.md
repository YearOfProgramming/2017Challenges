Idea
------
Given a sorted list of integers, your job is to go through the list and ...

For example the input [1,2,3,4,8,9,10,12,13,14]

would return

[1->4, 8->10, 12->14]

Another example, the input [1,2,3,4,9,10,15]

would return

[1->4,9->10]

More info:
* Assume the input will not be empty
* The list will always be ordered.
* The list will only contain integers.
