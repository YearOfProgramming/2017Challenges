#Solution

I think I got it. All my code does is stop everytime the range in the list breaks and puts the start and end of that range into
a list and then returns that list. Of course there are a couple of statements that check for special cases, but overall it seems
ok to me. I did get stuck on understanding what the prompt meant by ranges untill I noticed that it was just consecutive numbers...
whoops! Either way, it's all done now and I implemented a unit test of the given test cases and one really long one I made.

If you'd like to use my unit tests, all you have to do is implement your solution in my Solution.py. Change the code under the compRange function using the input parameters given. Copy my test.py and Solution.py before you edit them. Please don't make a pull request that writes over the code in my file.
