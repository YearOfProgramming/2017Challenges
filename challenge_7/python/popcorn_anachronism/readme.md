(Python 3.5)

Given a list of N integers whose values are in the range 0 to N, find the missing number.

Assume the list is not sorted, each value only appears once in the range, and only one number is missing.

Requirements: Do not sort the list of integers. The solution should use O(1) space and O(N) time.

This solution returns the difference between the sum of all elements in the range of 1 + the length of the given array, and the sum of all elements in the given list.
