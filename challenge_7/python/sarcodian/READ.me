Assume we are giving a list of unorder consective ints. We have to find
which int is missing. Since we know a single int is missing, we know
that the original list must have a length of given list + 1. 
Therefore, we sum all elements of range( lenght_of_given_list + 1) and 
subtract the sum of all elements in the given list.
