This was an easy one. I used a stack to push the first ocurrences of open paranthesis and when a 
closing paranthesis is encountered - popped an element from the stack and compared it to the 
current element. If they "match"(for eg: '(' with ')') for every occurence - the program returns
True else returns False.
