Karan Chawla
Challenge #9
```

I feel like I cheated in this challenge as instead of getting down to the crux of the problem
I just implemented **Counting Sort** as it works in O(n) and there's no bar on the maximum space
that can be used. 

To do: 
- [x] Implement O(n) solution.
- [ ] Man up and think about a better solution.
