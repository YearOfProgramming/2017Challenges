# Getting the Sorted Squares
--------

Given an ordered list of integers, contiguous or not and possibly containing negatives, return a sorted list of all squares of these integers in increasing order.

The function `get_sorted_squares` consumes a `Vec<i32>` and returns a `Vec<i32>`.

Test with `cargo test`, as per usual.
