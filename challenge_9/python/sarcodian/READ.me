Takes a list of sorted values and squares them, resorting 
the resulting list. The algorithm cannot use sort on the 
resulting list.

If the first element of the list is greater then 0, we can 
just return the list squared as tis already sorted.

Otherwise, we work backwards, but comparing the absolute value 
of the first element with the last element and squaring the largest.

We then return the reverse of the squared list to get it sorted from
smallest to largest.
