# Checkout Pull Request
#
# Usage:
#
# _bin/cpr get <username> <branch>, as seen when looking at a Pull Request on
# the web (see https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally/)
#
# _bin/cpr merge <username> <branch> will merge the PR into master and open up
# your editor for a commit message.
#
# This function is only useful for admins, as we are the only ones with write
# access to the central repository. Don't bother running this in a fork of the
# central unless you *yourself* have incoming pull requests.
