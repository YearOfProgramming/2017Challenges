reverse_string takes in a string s and outputs the reversed string. It works by making a copy of the string s in reverse order. Python has three arguements for slice, the first is the start point, the second is end point, and the third is the increment value. By putting two colons, we tell Python to use the default values (the start and end of the string) and the increment is -1, so it goes backwards.
