# Reverse a String
###### C++ 11

### 1. Approch to solving the problem

Iterate through the string to be reveresed starting from the end and add each those letter to another string that is output.

### 2. How to compile and run this

In Windows - I used the Visual Studio C++ compiler, move to the proper directory and run:

```
cl.exe /EHsc src/ReverseString.cpp
ReverseString.exe
```

### 3. How this program works

I take an input string and iterate through it backwards taking each letter and adding it to the back of the output string.
