#Challenge_1 Solution

To compile run: "csc.exe src\Reverse.cs" 
and run the resulting file with your sentence to reverse as arguments: "Reverse.exe Hello World!".

csc can be found in <windows installation folder>\Microsoft.NET\<Framework bitness>\<.NET version> 
(e.g. C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319)
or you can open a visual studio command prompt which adds the correct paths to its environment.
