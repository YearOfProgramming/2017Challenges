# Challenge 1 - Reverse a String
###### C#

### 1. Approach to Solving the problem

I had to work out how to get a string, then make it backwards. Turns out there are inbuilt functions for this.

### 2. How to compile and run this code

From the /src directory, use `csc.exe program.cs`

### 3. How this program works

Takes a string from the console input
Converts to a char array
Uses the 'System.Reverse' function to change the order of the characters
Displays the reversed string
