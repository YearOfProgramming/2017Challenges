This could have been done better, having a seperate linked list class isn't really needed at all but made the most sense in my head at the time. However, I am pretty happy with the algorithm for cloning the list, it runs in o(n) time and it does the cloning in place in 3 passes.

I'm still learning Python so my code is probably not very Pythonesque
