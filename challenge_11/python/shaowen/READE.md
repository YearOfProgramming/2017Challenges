###Challenge 11

Language Version: Python 2.7.12


### Solution

I did not manipulate bst before, so honestly, I first check the algorithms from the following link, before I implement it in python. I think the illustration is very clear, one could easily get the idea just by going through the graphs. So I would recommend to anyone who is not familiar with the algorithm behind.

(but java guys should be careful, a java version of implementation is down the page.)

### How to run
As requested, the program is designed to be interactive, so...
$ python bst.py

Please type in a list of node integer, seperated by space.

(now you could type in a list of number just like following to set up the bst)

5 2 3 12 9 21 19 25

Original bst list: 

 [5, 2, 3, 12, 9, 21, 19, 25]

Please type in one node integer you want to delete:

(now you could type in one integer, please just type in one, not two or more..well, just for test..)

12

New bst list:

[5, 2, 3, 19, 9, 21, 25]


###Testing

$ python unit_test.py
