### Description
This is a solution to the challenge #4 in C.
As a result of the program, you will see the following output in console.

```
Before
            /---9
      /---7
            \---6
    4
            /---3
      \---2
            \---1
After
            /---1
      /---2
            \---3
    4
            /---6
      \---7
            \---9
```

### Complexity
Complexity of insertion to a binary search tree has an order of O(logN) on average but traversing it needs O(N) constantly. So the complexity as whole is reduced to O(N).
