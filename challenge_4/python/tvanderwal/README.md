# Challenge 4

## Invert Binary Tree

### Use:
- Call function to take a binary tree and reverse it
- Must work on a tree of any size

### NOTE:
- Done with Python 3.5
- Originally was going to use printTree() but I didn't like displaying it in the classic 1 node per line. Easier to see what's going on printing as a tree
