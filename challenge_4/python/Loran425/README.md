## Implementation

  - Provides a `Node` class that has a left and right hand branch
    - `Node` has a member function `reverse()` such that the left and right hand branches of the node are swapped. 
    If the `recursive` flag is set to `True` (e.g. `reverse(recursive=True)` ) then all nodes below the calling node will be reversed.
