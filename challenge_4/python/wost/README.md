# Read me: Challenge 7
Special thanks to MicalV for his [https://github.com/YearOfProgramming/2017Challenges/blob/master/challenge_4/python/Mical/srs/main.py](great code), it really helped me
understand the binary tree!

## How to use:
Initialize a Tree by giving it an integer, this integer is converted to a Node
which is the type of the root of the tree. Every function that needs a node needs
the root Node.

## Known issues:
There are no real way for printing the tree, maybe I'll add it later.
You can print the first three nodes by using ```simple_print(tree.root._val)```.
