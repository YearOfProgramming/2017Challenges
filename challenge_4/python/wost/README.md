# Read me: Challenge 7

## How to use:
Initialize a Tree by giving it an integer, this integer is converted to a Node
which is the type of the root of the tree. Every function that needs a node needs
the root Node.

## Known issues:
There are no real way for printing the tree, maybe I'll add it later.
You can print the first three nodes by using ```simple_print(tree.root._val)```.
