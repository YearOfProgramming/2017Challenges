Invert Binary Tree

Python 3.6

1. Approch to Solving the problem

First I had to learn about Binary Trees.  I have never heard about such a thing so I googled it.
I found basic information about the subject then watched 4 different tutorials with 4 different ways of 
going about a solution.

2. How to compile and run this code

$ python binarytree1.py

3. How this program works

It prints out a binary tree the way it looks normally then prints the inverted right after, then for bonus
credit I have it print out in numerical order.
