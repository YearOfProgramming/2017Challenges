#Invert Binary Tree
###### Python 2.7.9

### 1. Approch to Solving the problem

The input will already be in an array in the code. No arguments received.
I need to implement three methods to achieve this challenge.
First, I'll need to implement an "insert" method. The insertion is done in the standard way we do with a binary tree.
Second, I need to be able to print a tree. There is many way to print a tree. I chose the "inorder" way. This is done recursively
Third, the master piece of the problem is the "invert" method. I'm gonna go with a recursive method again.
The call will be done on the left and right child. Then, the inversion of the left and right child will be done.

### 2. How to compile and run this code

Assuming you are within the directory under my name

```
$ python src/Challenge4.py
```

### 3. How this program works

You only need to run the program to see the output. The input is hardcoded in an array.
