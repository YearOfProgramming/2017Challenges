# Challenge_4 Solution

To compile run: "csc.exe src\Majority.cs" 
and run the resulting file with your tree as arguments in preorder position with null termination as '#' sign
For example: "Invert.exe 4 2 1 # # 3 # # 7 6 # # 9 # #". encodes the example tree given for challenge 4
and "Invert.exe P F B # # H G # # # S R # # Y T # W # # Z # #" encodes the tree as shown here: http://jcsites.juniata.edu/faculty/rhodes/cs2java/images/btreeTrav2.gif

csc can be found in <windows installation folder>\Microsoft.NET\<Framework bitness>\<.NET version> 
(e.g. C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319)
or you can open a visual studio command prompt which adds the correct paths to its environment.
