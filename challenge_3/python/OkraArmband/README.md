Run on Python 3.5.2

Input: list of entries to find a majority element from
Output: majority element

"Majority element" here refers to an element of a list that occurs the "majority" of the time (i.e. more than
half of the elements are identical to the majority element).

If no majority element is found, the function returns None.

To run: store list of interest as some variable, "var", then call:   findMajorityElement(var) for output.
