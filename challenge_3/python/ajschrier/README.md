# Challenge 3 - Majority Element

This uses the list.count builtin to find out how many of each element exists in the list. If the given element meets the condition (count > len/2), then that element is printed to the console and the loop breaks. 

I feel like I save some time by breaking the loop but there may be a more efficient way to do this. I'll probably revisit this in the future.
