# Challenge 2
## How to use

Add more function calls with test lists as parameters, seeing as this is Python, I won't have to think
about what types the array consists of, haha. This is a very minor tweak to my [solution for challenge 2](https://github.com/YearOfProgramming/2017Challenges/tree/master/challenge_2/python/wost)
*Note, the file may or may not be there*.

## Known issues

Will not give any output if nothing is found. Minor issue.
