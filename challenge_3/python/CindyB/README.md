#MajorityElement
###### Python 2.7.9

### 1. Approch to Solving the problem

I decided to reuse my solution to the "Single Number" challenge and adapt it.
Instead of looking for count equal to 1, I test for count greater than n/2. 

### 2. How to compile and run this code

Assuming you are within the directory under my name

```
$ python src/majorityElement.py
```

### 3. How this program works

You only need to run the program to see the output. No input needed.
