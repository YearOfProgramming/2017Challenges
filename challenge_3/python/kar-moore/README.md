maj_element takes in an array of integers as input. The program calculates the value of the majority needed by taking the length of the array and dividing by 2. Python integer division effectively floors values, so that is taken care of already here. Then, we build a dictionary that keeps track of the number of times a given number appears in the array. Once we have the dictionary mapping numbers to their count value, we iterate through the dictionary and see if any number of the array have a count value that is greater than or equal to the desired majority value. If so, we return that number.
