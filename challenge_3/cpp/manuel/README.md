# Majority Element

### 1. Approch to Solving the problem

My approach to solving this problem is to first find the max number 
in the given set of numbers

Once I have the max numbers, I create a counting array of the length of the max numbers
with all the values set to 0;

I then iterate through the set of numbers and increment the value of
each index of the count array for each value of the set of numbers

Example:
Given a set of numbers: 1,2,2,7,7

I create a count array of size 7 with all 0s: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As I iterate through those numbers i increment the matching index value
for that number in the count array.

The index that contains a value of n/2 is the majority element.

### 2. How to compile this code

Assuming you are within the directory under my name

```
$ g++ src/main.cpp src/majorityElement.cpp -o challenge_3.exe
$ ./challenge_3.exe < src/input
```

### 3. How this program works

I have a file in the src/ directory that you can modify. 
The first line is the number of testcases to test and following
that each line is a testcase.
