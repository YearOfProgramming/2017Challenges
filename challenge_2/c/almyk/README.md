The program will ask you to first input the size of the array,
then after that you need to fill in the integers.

in the function findSingleInt it will first loop the array to create all the nodes and increment their count's value if a reoccurring value appears in the array.

After it have created all the needed nodes, it goes through the linked list to find which value only appeared once.
If more than one such value exist, it reports so by incrementing the success value returned to main, to indicate failure.
