single_number takes in an array of integers as input. It goes through the list of integers and builds a dictionary that keeps track of how many times each number appears in the array (let's call this the count value). So if the number 8 appears three times, 8 will have a count value of three. After that dictionary is made, the program goes through the dictionary, and when it finds a number that has a count value of 1, it returns that number. Because the program iterates through each element of the array one time in the first for loop, this section is O(n). The next for loop is also O(n) time since the dictionary can is O(n) in length (though shorter since most of the elements appear more than once in the original array). All together, this is an O(n) program.
