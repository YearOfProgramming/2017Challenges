The program "unique_ele.py" has two methods in it: unique() and unique_v2(). Both of these functions carry out the same purpose and will function identically.

Both functions, when given an input list of an arbitrary number of arguments, will return the unique elements in the list. (That is, the elements which only appear one time in the list.)

However, unique() is a much less efficient algorithm, as its computational complexity is o(n^2), where unique_v2() has complexity o(n).
