#Single Number

##Premise

-	For this coding challenge you are given an array of random integers where every integer is repeated except for a single one. Your challenge is to find the single integer that does NOT repeat.

example: given array = [2,3,4,2,3,5,4,6,4,6,9,10,9,8,7,8,10,7] your program should return: 5

-	Assume that the array can hold infinitely many integers. Can you make your solution run in linear time O(n)? Good luck!

- attempt to search through the array with characters
extra credit: given array = [2,a,l,3,l,4,k,2,3,4,a,6,c,4,m,6,m,k,9,10,9,8,7,8,10,7] your program should return: c

##Implementation

- Provides a once function that returns all characters that occur only once.
