## Run

## Help
When you type 'default', the example list from the README.md in the challenge directory will be used.
All strings should be separated by whitespace!

## Explanation
The program takes the given input and formats it into a list with entries that were separated by white-
space in the input.
It then iterates over the list, making dictionary entries for each unique item with a count associated.
At the end, all items with count of 1 will be returned (printed) to the user.
