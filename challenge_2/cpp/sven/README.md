#Challenge_2 Solution

Under Windows - using the Visual studio c++ compiler:
To compile, run: "cl.exe src\Single.cpp" 
and run the resulting file with your sequence as arguments: "Single.exe 2 3 4 3 2 3 a a".

cl can be found in C:\Program Files (x86)\<Visual Studio folder>\VC\bin
(e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\bin)
or you can open a visual studio command prompt which adds the correct paths to its environment.

Under Linux - using the gcc compiler:
g++ src\Single.cpp && a.out
